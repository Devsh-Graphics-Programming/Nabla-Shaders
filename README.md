# Nabla Shader Compiler Library

A tool to meta-compile a subset of C++20 (mostly omitting runtime Standard Library features) to a domain specific Abstract Syntax Tree.

Also a library to allow you to transliterate entire GLSL codebases to C++, **it does NOT attempt to implement or define a _new_ shading language!**

This AST can be compiled, by a variety of backends, into beautiful name mangled GLSL, HLSL2021 or even SPIR-V.

This project is developed to be used by the [Nabla](https://github.com/Devsh-Graphics-Programming/Nabla) Rendering Framework, however after realizing its potential we decided to make develop it in a standalone repository.

**PROJECT IS CURRENTLY IN CONCEPTUALIZATION STAGE, DO NOT EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO USE IT.**

# Features compared to GLSL

- Namespaces
- Methods
- Templates

# Features compared to HLSL2021

- Templates more complex than C++03
- Ability to express all of GLSL (inline GLSL, extension enablement)
- Shader Module Linking (work with compilation results like you'd work with static libraries in C++)

The code in this repository is Dual Licensed to:

However these licenses only cover the Library's source code, not any output generated by its execution (whether compile time via template metaprogramming, or runtime), so the shaders you write and their compilation results remain your property to do with as you please.

# Commercial Support

# Backends

Due to current profit incentives DevSH Graphics Programming will only support and maintain a GLSL backend. Remaining

# Inspirations

SwiftShader's Reactor system for the idea to use overloaded operators on faux-standard-types with AST return types to build AST by writing what semantically looks like regular GLSL code.

ShaderWriter for an initial idea of the syntax for declaring new structs and being an example of the room for improvement.
